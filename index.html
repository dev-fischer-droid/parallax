    <p class="tex">
        Mountain biking is part of adventure tourism that has been running with full force in India.

It's not simple to take your bike wherever you want. You just can't ride it anywhere and everywhere. Mountain biking is a kind of adventure sport which can be enjoyed far off the roads, often of rugged hills and terrains. 
        <br> <br>
        India caters to all the needs one is looking for to get out of the city life and indulge into nature's beauty.
